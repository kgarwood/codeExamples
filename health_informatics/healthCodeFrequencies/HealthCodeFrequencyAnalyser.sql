 * HEALTH CODE FREQUENCY ANALYSIS SUITE 
 *    by Kevin Garwood
 * ====================================
 * This program tries shows an example of applying simple database operations 
 * to analyse the frequency with which health and operation codes appear alone 
 * and in combination within routinely collected hospital records.  The 
 * inspiration for this idea comes both from my own experience dealing with 
 * routinely collected health data and from taking Imperial College's Short 
 * Course on Big Data in Health.  Here we don't use real data but data sets that 
 * can be roughly modelled on the kinds of data you would find in records found 
 * in the UK's Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).  The goal of this script is to 
 * show how applying some basic informatics analysis can help researchers and 
 * hospital administrators do something very practical: to study the trends in 
 * the way health codes appear co-located within the same health record that 
 * charts a patient's journey through the healthcare system.

/*
 * To run this demo:
 * -----------------
 * (1) Download and install PostgreSQL v9.3 or later.
 * (2) Create a blank database (eg: 'healthcare_db')
 * (3) Jump ahead in the script to where you see #RUN_PROGRAM
 *     Uncomment one of the code lines indicated in the
 *     instructions shown there.
 * (3) You can run it in one of two ways: command line or 
 *     using PostgreSQL's built-in pgAdmin tool.  
 *     PostgreSQL so you can run it from command line
 * Command:
 * psql -U postgres -d healthcare_db 
 * -f C:\test_icd\HealthCodeFrequencyAnalyser.sql
 * 
 * or
 * 
 * (4) Open pgadmin and open the database you created 
 *     (eg: double-click on 'healthcare_db' you created).
 * (5) Click on the "Tools" menu, then "Query Tool".  You should see a dialog
 *     appear.  Copy and paste all of this script into the window and
 *     click the "Query" menu item, followed by "Execute".

/*
 * Overview of Patient Record Data Set we Imagine
 * ==============================================
 * One of my goals here is not to show you clever code, but to show you very 
 * basic code that can be used to support a practical purpose.  We begin with 
 * an understanding of our example data set, which is a very simple example 
 * based on data sets such as HES.  If you want to see how closely the example 
 * models a more realistic example, look up the "HES Inpatient Data Dictionary".
 * You can find it at:
 * 
 * The HES data dictionary defines dozens of fields that may appear in a single 
 * episode of health care for a patient.  Although there is a lot of information 
 * in the records, our example here is only concerned with the following 
 * concepts:
 * - date of event: (eg: admidate, or a year field may be good enough)
 * - health care provider: (eg: procodet, or other fields which refer to 
 *   organisation or 
 *   administrative area)
 * - health codes: (eg: ICD codes described in columns diag_01 to diag_20 
 *   inclusively)
 * - operation codes (eg: OPCS operation codes oper_01 to oper_24 inclusively)
 *
 * That's it! Here we don't even care about the patient's identifier or 
 * demographics.  Our concern is limited to analysing how codes (the health and 
 * operation codes) are collocated with another and how frequently they appear.
 *
 * In our example, we're going to just have these fields:
 * - year: the year of the health episode
 * - healthcare_provider: a code that represents some kind of healthcare 
 *   facility. Assume this is an 
 *   organisation of some kind.
 * - diag_01, diag_02, diag_03: to simulate the first few diagnostic codes you 
 *   would find in a real
 *   data dump of episode records.
 * - oper_01, oper_02: operation codes that describe what kind of operations 
 *   were 
 *   done to a patient.
 *
 * Our "patient_records" table will look like this:
 *
 * year health_care_provider diag_01 diag_02 diag_03 oper_01 oper_02
 * ...  ...                  ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
 */

/*
 * The Results We're Trying to Get
 * ===============================
 * In this section, we go over what we want to achieve from the program.
 * Our incoming table will look like this:
 * Table: "patient_records"
 * year health_care_provider diag_01 diag_02 diag_03 oper_01 oper_02
 * ...  ...                  ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
 *
 * At a minimum, we want to produce the following tables, which are ordered 
 * by decreasing frequency.
 *
 * 1. Frequency of codes, regardless of year or healthcare provider. Ordered 
 *    by descending frequency
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Table: code_frequencies_general
 * code frequency
 * ...  ...
 *
 * 2. Frequency of codes based on year. Ordered first by descending 
 *    year, then descending frequency.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Table: code_frequencies_year
 * year code num_occurrences
 * ...  ...  ...
 * 
 * 3. Frequency of codes based on healthcare provider. Ordered first by 
 *    ascending healthcare, then by descending frequency.
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Table: code_frequencies_provider
 * health_care_provider code frequency
 * ...                  ...  ... 
 * 
 * 4. Frequency of codes based on year and healthcare provider.  Ordered 
 *    first by ascending healthcare provider, second by descending year 
 *    and third by descending frequency
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Table: code_frequencies_provider_year
 * healthcare_provider year frequency
 * ...                 ...  ...
 * 
 * 5. Frequency of co-located codes in general.  Ordered by ascending 
 *    code and decreasing frequency.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Table: coloc_code_general
 * code other_code frequency 
 * ...  ...        ...
 *
 * 6. Frequency of co-located codes by year.  Ordered by descending year,
 *    then descending frequency
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Table: coloc_code_year
 * year code other_code frequency
 * ...  ...  ...        ...

/*
 * Overview of Algorithm for Creating Code Frequency Analyses
 * ==========================================================
 * For many, this algorithm will not appear to be anything advanced or
 * sophisticated. It also hasn't necessarily been designed with performance
 * in mind.  However, it is simple and therefore amenable to being adapted
 * by others using basic SQL skills and free open source tools.
 *
 * Step 1: Obtain patient record data in table with expected fields.
 *
 * Step 2: In one table, create a collection of codes that appear anywhere
 *         in the coding fields.  It will likely contain duplicate records
 *         and have the following fields:
 *         year healthcare_provider code
 * 
 * Step 3: Create reports for frequency analysis of individual codes.  For
 *         this part of the analysis, we don't care what other terms appear
 *         beside them and in some cases they may appear alone.
 * 
 * Step 4: Begin work to support co-located term analysis. Create a new table
 *         which removes the duplicates in Step 2, to produce a table of 
 *         unique codes.  It will unique row entries that have the fields:
 *         year, healthcare_provider, code.
 *
 * Step 5: In another table, merge all of the coding fields into a single 
 *         text phrase, where terms are separated by a delimiter (eg: comma).
 * 
 * Step 6: Combine the table in Step 2 with the table in Step 3 based on year,
 *         healthcare provider, and whether a unique term in Step 2 appears in 
 *         a single text phrase in Step 3.  We will have a table with these 
 *         fields:
 *         year, health_provider, code, single_coding_phrase.
 *
 * Step 7: Using the combined table from Step 4, explode the single text 
 *         phrase back into individual terms and make a row for each combination 
 *         of a unique code and one of the terms.  We will now have a table that
 *         has the fields year, health_provider, code, other_code.  'code'
 *         comes from 'code' in Step 4 and each value of other_code will have 
 *         been parsed from a single_coding_phrase.
 * 
 * Step 8: Remove occurrences where code appears by an empty other_code entry.
 * 
 * Step 9: Remove occurrences where code and other_code are identical.  By now
 *         we will have a table that serves as the basis for all other analyses
 *         relating to co-located codes. It will have the fields: 
 *         year health_provider code other_code.
 *
 * Step 10: Aggregate rows in Table 7 to suit different reports about 
 *          frequencies of co-located codes.
 *
 * The steps will be described in the following sections

 * Step 1: Obtaining the Example Patient Data Set (Hard Coded Values)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The routines in this section create the example patient record data set, 
 * either through adding hard-coded data found in this script or by importing 
 * the data from CSV files.  The program that does frequency analysis does not 
 * attach meaning to any of the codes and even if it did, it probably shouldn't. 
 * Data entry habits can vary depending on year, the practices of healthcare 
 * providers or the preferences of individual hospital staff members.  From the 
 * program's point of view, they're all just codes and it doesn't care why one 
 * code is related to another, or whether those combinations even make sense 
 * from a healthcare or epidemiological perspective.
